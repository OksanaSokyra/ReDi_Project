       <h3 style="font-family: monospace, Courier; color:white; font-size:large;"> 
           Sometimes we all need a small piece of inspiration. 
          <br><br> And where can we find more inspiration 
          <br>than within the philosophy?
          <br><br><br> This project was designed to light up every day 
          <br>with a short phrase 
          <br> and make it a little bit more inspiring. 
          <br> The choice of quotes is based on the birthdate 
          <br> or date of death of the philosophers. 
          <br><br> So, pick up any date from 01.01 to 31.01 
          <br> to see which philosopher was born or died that day, 
          <br> and what was one of his/her´s most wise words.
